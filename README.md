## Oh, Hello! ðŸ––

I am Erdem. I am an entrepreneur, designer, developer, writer and dreamer.

Since I am an appetite on UI / UX and Frontend,
I am consuming what I find nowadays.
And I wrote some stories, you can find on my site.

#### UI / UX
Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Overflow, MockUp

#### Frontend
Javascript, major javascript frameworks, SSR javascript frameworks, javascript for backend, javascript supersets, and voila! React-Native!, CSS and the extensions, package builders, mongo like DB systems etc..

Yeah, I know there are a lot of things. But these days, the industry demands a lot of things, you know.
Thanks!

Live long and prosper.
