## Hey there 🖐

I'm a software developer and system architect working mostly with TypeScript, Node.js, and backend tooling.
I like building small, practical utilities and frameworks that stay clear, predictable, and easy to maintain.

Lately, I've been exploring state models, lightweight execution runtimes, and structured-data helpers shaped directly by real project constraints.
