# Ave, Visitor

I am Erdem — developer, architect, and keeper of deterministic state.
My craft is TypeScript and Node.js, forging backend tools that are small in size, but relentless in purpose.

I prefer clarity over chaos. Explicit contracts. Minimal dependencies. Code that behaves the same today, tomorrow, and under fire.

Recent campaigns include state-infrastructure experiments, lightweight runtimes, and structured-data utilities — engineered to endure long after deployment banners fall.
