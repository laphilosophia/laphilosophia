## Hey!

Software developer working with JavaScript and TypeScript.  
I build small, well-defined backend utilities and libraries with a focus on clarity, correctness, and maintainability.

**Core:** TypeScript · Node.js · API design · data structures  
**Approach:** simple abstractions, explicit behavior, minimal dependencies

Selected work includes low/no-code framework, structured data utilities, and reusable helper libraries.
